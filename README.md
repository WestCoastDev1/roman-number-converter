# roman-number-converter
a trivial number converter for Roman Numerals to regular Integers between 1 and 3999

The two input fields on the page take:

firstly   - (top input field) 
  'Roman' or 'Numeral' as text inputs to provide a Type
  
secondly  - (lower input field) 
  In the case of type 'Roman' accepts Roman numerals between I and MMMCMXCIX
  In the case of type 'Numeric' accepts integer values between 1 and 3999
  
The convert button will provide an output to the right giving any correctly resulting values,
there is validation but no message on non-correct inputs.

The clear buttn will clear both fields for fresh input.
